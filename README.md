# Algorithms and data structures
Various algortihms and data structures implemented in the C language for
presentational purposes only.
## Implementation
For the purpose of demonstrational simplicity, everything was
implemented for the simplest usage case possible. For example, sorting
algorithms are implemented for sorting arrays of integers only,
and are sorting in non descending order.
